CPD similarities were obtained from the Chemical Checker (CC) database https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0502-7

Using the Compound universe defined by the datasets incorporated in the KG, we computed the top 10 nearest neighbour for each compound according to the cosine distance and the 25 CC signatures (vector of 25x128d). Neighbours with a cosine distance higher than 0.5  (corresponding to a 0.01 empirical p-value) were excluded.
