3. Drugcentral

	  ---> Connect to you psql and create a database called 'drugcentral' --> 'CREATE DATABASE drugcentral;'
	  ---> Exit the psql and import the drugcentral SQL database by running (in the terminal) --> 'psql drugcentral < drugcentral.sql'
--> Read the table called "atc" from the drugcentral sql database and save it as a tab separated file in this folder with the name "drugcentral_atcs.tsv"

Once all the files are in place (inside this folder) just run 'python3 script.py'
