Data was obtained from SIDER.

We kept all the side effects classifed as: 'common', 'very frequent', 'frequent' ,'very common'. Moreover, we added side effects that were present in more than 5% of the population with respect to the placebo. If a drug had no side effect meeting those requierements, we added those present in at least 5% of the population (ignoring the placebo).
