CPD similarities were obtained from the raw data of used for the "the A1 space" in Chemical Checker database https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0502-7.

Using the Compound universe defined by the datasets incorporated in the KG, we computed tanimoto similarities between the ECFP4 signatures of the compounds. A 0.7 similarity cutoff was used to obtain the similar CPD-CPD pairs.
