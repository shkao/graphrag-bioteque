DB00195	DB00668	Beta-Blockers such as betaxolol may enhance the vasopressor effect of epinephrine. Monitor for increases in pressor effects of alpha-/beta-agonists if used in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy (including ophthalmic products). Beta1-selective (i.e., “cardioselective”) agents may confer a more limited risk if used in low enough doses to allow them to retain their selectivity. The amount of epinephrine used in dental procedures as part of local anesthetic administration is not likely to be of clinical concern. Infiltrating larger volumes of local anesthetics for other surgical procedures (e.g., more than 0.06mg epinephrine) may cause clinically-relevant problems. Patients with allergies that require carrying and periodically using subcutaneous epinephrine (e.g., bee sting kits) should probably avoid the use of beta blockers.

Ophthalmic beta-blockers are likely of little concern.
DB00195	DB00328	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents such as indomethacin may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Beta-Blockers such as betaxolol. Monitor for increases in blood pressure if a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) is initiated/dose increased, or decreases in blood pressure if a NSAID is discontinued/dose decreased; this is particularly important if NSAID treatment is for extended periods of time.

Ophthalmic beta-blockers are likely of little concern.
DB00195	DB00457	Beta-Blockers such as betaxolol may enhance the orthostatic hypotensive effect of Alpha1-Blockers such as prazosin. The risk associated with ophthalmic products is probably less than systemic products. Exercise caution if an alpha1-blocker is added to existing beta-blocker therapy. Monitor for hypotension during first few days of concomitant therapy. A priori reduction in alpha1-blocker (especially systemic) dose may be warranted. Administering the first dose of systemic agents at bedtime may help minimize risk of severe hypotension. The risk associated with the use of ophthalmic products in either interacting group is probably less than that associated with systemic agents. If the alpha1-blocker is being used to treat BPH, consider using tamsulosin since its alpha1-A selectivity is least likely to cause hypotension.
DB00195	DB00912	The beta-blocker, betaxolol, may decrease symptoms of hypoglycemia.

The Canadian roflumilast product monograph recommends avoiding concurrent use of roflumilast with any immunosuppressant medications due to the antiinflammatory/immune altering effects of roflumilast and the lack of relevant clinical experience with such use. Of note, this recommendation to avoid concurrent use does not apply to either inhaled corticosteroids (which have much more limited systemic immune-suppressing actions) or short-term systemic corticosteroid use. U.S. prescribing information does not contain this warning; but it appears prudent to avoid this combination when possible.

Of note, this recommendation to avoid concurrent use does not apply to either inhaled corticosteroids (which have much more limited systemic immune-suppressing actions) or short-term systemic corticosteroid use. U.S. prescribing information does not contain this warning; but it appears prudent to avoid this combination when possible.

Of note, this recommendation to avoid concurrent use does not apply to either inhaled corticosteroids (which have much more limited systemic immune-suppressing actions) or short-term systemic corticosteroid use. U.S. prescribing information does not contain this warning; but it appears prudent to avoid this combination when possible.

DB00631	DB01097	Immunosuppressants such as clofarabine may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of leflunomide. Specifically, the risk for hematologic toxicity such as pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and/or thrombocytopenia may be increased. Consider eliminating the use of a leflunomide loading dose in patients who are receiving other immunosuppressants in order to reduce the risk for serious adverse events such as hematologic toxicity. Also, patients receiving both leflunomide and another immunosuppressive medication should be monitored for bone marrow suppression at least monthly throughout the duration of concurrent therapy.
DB00631	DB00108	Immunosuppressants such as clofarabine may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of natalizumab. Specifically, the risk of concurrent infection may be increased.

DB00631	DB01656	Roflumilast may enhance the immunosuppressive effect of Immunosuppressants. The Canadian roflumilast product monograph recommends avoiding concurrent use of roflumilast with any immunosuppressant medications due to the antiinflammatory/immune altering effects of roflumilast and the lack of relevant clinical experience with such use. Of note, this recommendation to avoid concurrent use does not apply to either inhaled corticosteroids (which have much more limited systemic immune-suppressing actions) or short-term systemic corticosteroid use. U.S. prescribing information does not contain this warning; but it appears prudent to avoid this combination when possible.

DB00668	DB00195	Beta-Blockers such as betaxolol may enhance the vasopressor effect of epinephrine. Monitor for increases in pressor effects of alpha-/beta-agonists if used in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy (including ophthalmic products). Beta1-selective (i.e., “cardioselective”) agents may confer a more limited risk if used in low enough doses to allow them to retain their selectivity. The amount of epinephrine used in dental procedures as part of local anesthetic administration is not likely to be of clinical concern. Infiltrating larger volumes of local anesthetics for other surgical procedures (e.g., more than 0.06mg epinephrine) may cause clinically-relevant problems. Patients with allergies that require carrying and periodically using subcutaneous epinephrine (e.g., bee sting kits) should probably avoid the use of beta blockers.

DB01436	DB00930	Bile acid sequestrants such as colesevelam may decrease the serum concentration of Vitamin D Analogs. More specifically, bile acid sequestrants may impair absorption of Vitamin D Analogs. Avoid concomitant administration of vitamin D analogs and bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine). Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients receiving combined therapy with these agents. This is particularly important in patients receiving higher doses of a bile acid sequestant (i.e., 30 g/day or more of cholestyramine or equivalent) or in patients experiencing bile acid sequestrant-induced steatorrhea. Specific recommendations regarding the separation of administration of these agents are not defined; however, it would seem prudent to separate the administration of these agents by several hours to minimize the potential risk of interaction.

DB06717	DB01285	Fosaprepitant may increase the serum concentration of Corticosteroids (Systemic). The active metabolite aprepitant is likely responsible for this effect. The manufacturer of fosaprepitant states that oral dexamethasone doses should be reduced by 50% when coadministered with a fosaprepitant/aprepitant regimen to achieve dexamethasone concentrations similar to those achieved with dexamethasone alone.1 Dexamethasone doses used in clinical chemotherapy nausea/vomiting studies with aprepitant reflect this 50% decrease. Similarly, it is recommended that in order to achieve concentrations similar to those achieved with methylprednisolone alone, the intravenous methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by 25% and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by 50% when given together with a fosaprepitant/aprepitant regimen.
