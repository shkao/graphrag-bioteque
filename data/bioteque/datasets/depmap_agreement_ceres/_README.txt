The CLL-GEN dependencies binary data (CRISPRcleanR_binary.tsv) and the pan essentials (panessential_tiers.csv) were obtained from the publication "Integrated cross-study datasets of genetic dependencies in cancer" More specifically, we obtained the files 'BinaryCERES4m.RData' and 'TierCE.csv' from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pe1YP-rRgtNBmTJYhoMYL4wdnsZdW-HQ. The cl_models metadata (cl_models.csv) was obtained from the 'annotated  models' file available at: https://cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk/downloads.

When obtaining the GEN-GEN codependencies, we obtained pearson and spearman correlations between their fitness vectors and used a cutoff of 0.2 to be considered a co-dependency (corresponding to a empirical p-value of 0.001).
