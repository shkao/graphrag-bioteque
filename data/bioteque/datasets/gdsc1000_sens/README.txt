Data was obtained from the PharmacoDB database.

AOC were transformed into AUC (1-AOC). 
To binarize the drug sensitivty we implemented the waterfall method (as first described elsewhere DOI: 10.1038/nature11003).
We required at least an AUC <0.9, and minimum of 1% and maximum of 20% sensitive cell lines for each drug.
